PowerMac Is Only Made For Kext Drivers (atleast for now) So Other Options are not available except "Download kexts, Download All Kexts"


It Will Get updates In the Near Future.


remember to cd the location of the folder and then go to command prompt and put in this "python powermac.py" Remember to install the python command lines from the Microsoft store!
